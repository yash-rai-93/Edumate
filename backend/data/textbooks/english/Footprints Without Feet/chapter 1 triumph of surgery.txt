CHAPTER 1: A TRIUMPH OF SURGERY – EXTENSIVE NOTES

---------------------------------------------------
1. Introduction
---------------------------------------------------
“A Triumph of Surgery” by James Herriot is a heartwarming story about a small dog named Tricki, whose owner Mrs. Pumphrey spoils him with excessive food and affection. As a result, Tricki becomes extremely fat and ill. The chapter shows how proper care, discipline, and controlled diet can bring positive change, even more than love alone.

---------------------------------------------------
2. Summary
---------------------------------------------------
Tricki, a pampered pet dog, is overfed by his owner Mrs. Pumphrey. She gives him rich food, sweets, snacks, and treats all day. Tricki becomes overweight, lazy, and unhealthy.

When Dr. Herriot, the veterinarian, sees Tricki’s condition, he realizes that the dog needs strict control. Mrs. Pumphrey becomes emotional, but Dr. Herriot takes Tricki to his clinic for treatment.

At the clinic, Tricki is given a simple routine:  
- No overfeeding  
- Normal, healthy dog food  
- Exercise  
- Playtime with other dogs

Slowly, Tricki becomes active, energetic, and healthy again. Mrs. Pumphrey is overjoyed by Tricki’s recovery and calls it “a triumph of surgery,” even though no surgery was actually done—just proper care and diet.
