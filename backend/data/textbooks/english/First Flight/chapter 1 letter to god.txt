CHAPTER 1: A LETTER TO GOD – EXTENSIVE NOTES

---------------------------------------------------
1. Introduction
---------------------------------------------------
“A Letter to God,” written by G.L. Fuentes, is a story about extreme faith and innocence. It revolves around a poor farmer named Lencho, who firmly believes in God’s help even in the worst situations. The chapter highlights themes of hope, trust, kindness, and irony.

---------------------------------------------------
2. Summary
---------------------------------------------------
Lencho, a hardworking farmer, lives with his family on a hill. He is very hopeful about a good harvest. However, a sudden hailstorm destroys his entire crop, leaving him devastated.

Believing that only God can help him, Lencho writes a letter to God asking for 100 pesos to sow his crop again and support his family.

When the postmaster reads the letter, he is touched by Lencho’s faith. He collects money from his employees and contributes some himself. However, they gather only 70 pesos. The postmaster sends the money to Lencho, signing it as “God.”

When Lencho receives the money, he becomes angry because he expected the full 100 pesos. He believes God cannot make mistakes, so he assumes the post office employees have stolen the rest. He writes another letter to God asking Him not to send money through the post office as they are “a bunch of crooks.”
