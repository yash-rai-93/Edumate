2. RESOURCES AND DEVELOPMENT – MEGA NOTES
====================================================================

WHAT ARE RESOURCES?
Anything that satisfies human needs and is technologically accessible is known as a resource.

Characteristics:
• Utility  
• Value  
• Availability  
• Technology determines usability  

--------------------------------------------------------------------
TYPES OF RESOURCES
--------------------------------------------------------------------

1. Based on Origin:
• Biotic – living organisms (plants, animals, humans)
• Abiotic – non-living things (minerals, metals, water)

2. Based on Renewability:
• Renewable – can be replenished naturally (wind, solar, forests)
• Non-renewable – limited (coal, petroleum)

3. Based on Ownership:
• Individual resources – farmers’ land, houses
• Community resources – grazing ground, parks, burial grounds
• National resources – forests, minerals, water bodies
• International resources – oceans beyond 200 nautical miles

4. Based on Development:
• Potential resources – available but not used (Rajasthan wind)
• Developed resources – currently used
• Stock – have potential but technology missing
• Reserves – can be used with existing technology

--------------------------------------------------------------------
RESOURCE PLANNING
--------------------------------------------------------------------
India follows systematic planning to manage resources.

Steps:
1. Resource identification and mapping
